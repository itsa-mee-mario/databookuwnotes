In SVD, 

$$
X = U\Sigma V^{T} = \hat{U}\hat{\Sigma}V^{T}
$$


$U, \ V$ are Unitary Matrices



### Unitary matrix:
$$
UU^{T=}U^{TU}= I, \ VV^{T=V^{T}V}=I
$$

(in case of economy SVD, only $\hat{U}\hat{U}^{T}$ will be equal to the identity matrix, and not $\hat{U}^{T}\hat{U}$ )

 Preserve angles and lengths in the space it is transforming
 
 
 ### Fourier transorm:
 takes a vector space, and is a coordinate transform into a new representation where they become simpler, where the angles between vectors remains same
 
 (kinda like constellations in the sky. they rotate around but angles and lengths remain same)
 
 
 $$
 <x, y> = <Ux, Uy> \forall x, y \in R^n
 $$
