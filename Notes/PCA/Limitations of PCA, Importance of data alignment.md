SVD is fundamentally GEOMETRIC. 
It depends on the coordinate system in which the data is given. It does not have translational or rotational or scale invariance, and the rank of the output explodes when the data doesnt have coherent geometry.

This is also a strength of SVD: its dependence on inner products is essential of geometric intepretations.
