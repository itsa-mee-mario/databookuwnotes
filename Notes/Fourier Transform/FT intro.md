# Fourier Transform
A way of approximating solutions of partial differential equations, developed specefically for the heat equation

### Heat Equation
Imagine a square with temprature distribution $u(x, y, t)$
then 
$$u_{t}= \alpha\nabla^{2}u$$
fourier discovered that the transoform diagonalizes the Laplacian operator. He showed that the laplacian has eigenvalues anf eigenfunctions like other linear operators and eigenfunctions are sins and cosins according to boundary conditions.

It is a way to tranform the heat equation to th eigen-space to make it easier to solve.

FT has applications in a lot of things like image compression etc.


SVD is like a data driven extention of FFT

You can approximate an arbitrary function by a sequence of sins and cosins of increasing frequencies
