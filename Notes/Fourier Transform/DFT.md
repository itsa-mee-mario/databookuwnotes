# Discrete fourier transform 
- in real life situations, we might have a vector of data from an experiment measured at some particular values, and we assume that there is an undelying continuous function that we have sampled from.
- we want to break that data into a sum of sines and cosines
- basically a Fourier Series on data instead of continuous functions

  when computing or working with real-
data, it is necessary to approximate the Fourier transform on discrete vectors of
data. The resulting discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is essentially a discretized version of the Fourier series for vectors of data obtained by discretizing the function f (x) at a regular spacing, âˆ†x
