> solution of the system only exists if $b$ is in the column space of $A$ ($col(A)$)

# fundamental sub-spaces defined by the matrix A:

1. column space of A: set of all vectors that can be written as a linear combination of the columns of given matrix (called range) ($col (\hat U)$)
2. orthagonal complement ($ker(A^T)$): no solution 
3. row space of A: $col(V)$
4. kernel of A: (null space): set of all vectors $x$ such that $Ax=0$

if there are any vectors in the null space (the kernel of A), there will be infinite solutions

$$A(x + x_{null}) = b$$

where $x_{null}$ is a vector in the null space of A (so its product with A is zero)
